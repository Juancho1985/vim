Introduction:
-------------
This is my vim editor. It has a lot of different things, like syntastic wich helpme to check syntactic errors for vim, snipmates, tabular... and more. I also added a 256 color scheme. Actually I just put this in git in order to just download it from wherever I want and keep on having my Text editor uptodate with my personal settings. I beleive it is the best editor to work with. Enjoy it.

Objective:
----------
Save my personal editor in a repository in order to get it anytime I need.

I have my personal settings here, but I have nothing to do with everything in behind, what I mean is that everything here, is just an excelent text editor with personal configurations, and a few pluggins I didnot do.
